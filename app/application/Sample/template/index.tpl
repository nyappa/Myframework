<div>
There is only a controller in this framework now.<br> 
Smarty is used for a template engine. <br>
When you develop, please create the folder for every application to an application folder,<br>
and create the class of the name of controller_hogeho in it.<br>
<br>
The template file should create a template folder to the folder for every application, <br>
and should create it there. <br>
